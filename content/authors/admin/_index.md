I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at o9 Solutions. I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intellgence from SUNY Buffalo, where I primarily worked on Distributed Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Prior to that, I worked at Fidelity Investments as a Data Scientist/Software Engineer on Natural Language Processing solutions for Enterprise Infrastructure. My research interests include Distributed Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and photography.
